# weeb-board
As per a request of a friend, I put this on GitHub.
A quite old and crappy-looking WinForms-Application which makes
each and every single one of your keypresses **moan** (definitely NSFW).

## Dependencies
.NET Framework 4.7.2 \
(Outdated, but should just work on current windows versions)

## Building
You can build this application without Visual Studio, but since this
project uses the .NET **Framework**, it's rather complicated. (The `dotnet`-CLI is made for .NET 5+) \
Just use Visual Studio. \
Binary builds are not provided, so you have to do this yourself :)

## UI
Upon start you're greeted by this window:

![Window Screenshot](/assets/window.png)

## Sound files
The sound files in the [Resources](/Moaner/Resources/) directory are cut out from a youtube video
which may have been deleted by now. (I cannot find it anymore)

## Note
please don't judge me for this. this was made as a joke during school.
